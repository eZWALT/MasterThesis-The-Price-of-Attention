## Writing / Overleaf

- Start with `.agents/context/writing/README.md`, then the newest dated entry
  in that directory.
- **Source of truth for manuscript content is only the Overleaf Git repos under
  `docs/overleaf/`** (especially `publication/` and `thesis/`). Context notes
  summarize decisions; they never override the LaTeX.
- Pull the relevant Overleaf mirror before drafting or editing. Show proposed
  text before applying; push only after explicit approval.
- **Results ≠ Discussion.** Results report estimands and numbers.
  Discussion interprets (precise null vs dead pipeline, Path B not
  absence, abstract placement, design implications, H1–H3). EEG 6.3 is
  confirmatory; 7.3 is the EEG read. Lock:
  `.agents/context/writing/2026-08-21-results-vs-discussion-and-eeg-6-3-pushed.md`.
- Canonical ad labels: **implicit** vs **explicit**; early = turn 2; late =
  turn 4; five-condition repeated-measures (+ no-ad control). Implicit does
  not mean subliminal.

## Data analysis

- Start with `.agents/context/data-analysis/README.md`, then the relevant arm's
  `README.md`; prefer the newest dated entry.
- Verify durable summaries against executable code and generated manifests.
- Keep raw Bronze/XDF immutable; add versioned Silver, Gold, statistics, or
  analysis outputs instead.
- EEG code lives in `analysis/eeg/`; generated EEG data lives under
  `src/project/logs/xdf/`.
- Treat participants—not epochs—as inferential units.
- Record scientific decisions in `.agents/context/data-analysis/`.
- EEG paper figure cut and Results sentences:
  `.agents/context/data-analysis/eeg/2026-08-20-paper-figures-and-narrative.md`.
  Depth audit (MDE, compatibility, exploratory lock):
  `.agents/context/data-analysis/eeg/2026-08-20-paper-depth-audit.md`.
  Confirmatory is 4 s + median + ICA. C1 is blocked on Goal 1.

## General

- Do not commit or push unless explicitly requested.
