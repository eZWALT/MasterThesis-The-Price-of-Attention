# Agent entrypoint

- Start with `.agents/context/data-analysis/README.md`, then the relevant arm's
  `README.md`; prefer the newest dated entry.
- Verify durable summaries against executable code and generated manifests.
- Keep raw Bronze/XDF immutable; add versioned Silver, Gold, statistics, or
  analysis outputs instead.
- EEG code lives in `analysis/eeg/`; generated EEG data lives under
  `src/project/logs/xdf/`.
- Treat participants—not epochs—as inferential units.
- Record scientific decisions in `.agents/context/data-analysis/`.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly requested.
